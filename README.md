# Wappalyzer-Alternative
I built an alternative to Wappalyzer which detects over 1400+ technologies, include ones that are hard/impossible to detect from just the website. This includes things like devops tools, security tools, CRMs, ERPS and AI tools. This repo contains code samples on how to access the API and start making API calls.
